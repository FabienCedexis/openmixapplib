# Application: **Softlayer Integration**

This app demonstrates using real time data from Softlayer for decision making. Using FusionCustom, we will dynamically collect server network status over their REST API and depending on status, switch between hosts. Refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/cedexis/openmixapplib/wiki/Softlayer-Integration) for more details.
# Openmix Application Library

[Cedexis Openmix](http://www.cedexis.com/products/openmix.html) applications
give you dynamic, flexible, and automatic control over where your traffic is
routed so that your business goals are achieved. Openmix applications are
programmed in [PHP](http://www.php.net), a commonly used server-side language
accessible to most web programmers and network administrators.

These Openmix Application PHP scripts are used by specialized DNS servers to respond to DNS requests based on the logic in the scripts. Deployment of the scripts is done via our [customer portal](https://portal.cedexis.com/) or [web services API](https://github.com/cedexis/webservices/wiki).

Learn how to use the library to make your own applications in
[the wiki](https://github.com/cedexis/openmixapplib/wiki).
