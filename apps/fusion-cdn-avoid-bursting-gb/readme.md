# Application: **Avoid CDN Bursting Charges by tracking MBPS via Fusion Data API**

This version of the Optimal Round Trip Time application allows you track your monthly 95/5 MBPS usage via that CDN's API. If your usage exceeds your commit, penalize that CDN enough to avoid a bursting charge. Otherwise use the Optimal Round Trip time approach.

# Openmix Application Library

[Cedexis Openmix](http://www.cedexis.com/products/openmix.html) applications
give you dynamic, flexible, and automatic control over where your traffic is
routed so that your business goals are achieved. Openmix applications are
programmed in [PHP](http://www.php.net), a commonly used server-side language
accessible to most web programmers and network administrators.

These Openmix Application PHP scripts are used by specialized DNS servers to respond to DNS requests based on the logic in the scripts. Deployment of the scripts is done via our [customer portal](https://portal.cedexis.com/) or [web services API](https://github.com/cedexis/webservices/wiki).

Learn how to use the library to make your own applications in
[the wiki](https://github.com/cedexis/openmixapplib/wiki).
