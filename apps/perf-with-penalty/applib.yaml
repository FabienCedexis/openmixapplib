  The routing provided by the basic performance application is great for certain cases, but there are times when you know that you only want to use a specific platform when others are considerably worse. For example, you might only want to send traffic to your origin when it is significantly better than any other choice.  

  This application shows how this can work by using the concept of ‘padding’ to increase the value of the performance measure being used to decide where to send traffic.
