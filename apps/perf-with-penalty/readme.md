# Application: **Performance Routing with Platform Penalty**

The routing provided by the basic performance application is great for certain cases, but there are times when you know that you only want to use a specific platform when others are considerably worse. For example, you might only want to send traffic to your origin when it is significantly better than any other choice.  

This application shows how this can work by using the concept of ‘padding’ to increase the value of the performance measure being used to decide where to send traffic.

# Openmix Application Library

[Cedexis Openmix](http://www.cedexis.com/products/openmix.html) applications
give you dynamic, flexible, and automatic control over where your traffic is
routed so that your business goals are achieved. Openmix applications are
programmed in [PHP](http://www.php.net), a commonly used server-side language
accessible to most web programmers and network administrators.

These Openmix Application PHP scripts are used by specialized DNS servers to respond to DNS requests based on the logic in the scripts. Deployment of the scripts is done via our [customer portal](https://portal.cedexis.com/) or [web services API](https://github.com/cedexis/webservices/wiki).

Learn how to use the library to make your own applications in
[the wiki](https://github.com/cedexis/openmixapplib/wiki).
