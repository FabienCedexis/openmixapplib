    Demonstrates how to manage provider destination hostnames outside of the Openmix PHP. App uses Fusion Custom (AKA Pulse Load) to pull in a list of destinations linked to unique site names. Then, if a subdomain is appended to the Openmix name, it checks the subdomain against the site names in the file and modifies the destination returned.
