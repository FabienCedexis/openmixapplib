New Relic is a SaaS-based cloud application performance management provider that offers rich application performance data as part of its service. Cedexis Openmix can use this data to take action on the current state of your application as measured by New Relic. For example, if New Relic reports high CPU load on an application you can have Openmix direct traffic to a less loaded instance of your application.

This sample application demonstrates the use of New Relic data in an Openmix application.

# Openmix Application Library

[Cedexis Openmix](http://www.cedexis.com/products/openmix.html) applications
give you dynamic, flexible, and automatic control over where your traffic is
routed so that your business goals are achieved. Openmix applications are
programmed in [PHP](http://www.php.net), a commonly used server-side language
accessible to most web programmers and network administrators.

These Openmix Application PHP scripts are used by specialized DNS servers to respond to DNS requests based on the logic in the scripts. Deployment of the scripts is done via our [customer portal](https://portal.cedexis.com/) or [web services API](https://github.com/cedexis/webservices/wiki).

Learn how to use the library to make your own applications in
[the wiki](https://github.com/cedexis/openmixapplib/wiki).
