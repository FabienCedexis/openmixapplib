# Application: **Load External Config**

Demonstrates how to manage provider destination hostnames outside of the Openmix PHP. App uses Fusion Custom (AKA Pulse Load) to pull in a list of destinations linked to unique site names. Then, if a subdomain is appended to the Openmix name, it checks the subdomain against the site names in the file and modifies the destination returned.

# Openmix Application Library

[Cedexis Openmix](http://www.cedexis.com/products/openmix.html) applications
give you dynamic, flexible, and automatic control over where your traffic is
routed so that your business goals are achieved. Openmix applications are
programmed in [PHP](http://www.php.net), a commonly used server-side language
accessible to most web programmers and network administrators.

These Openmix Application PHP scripts are used by specialized DNS servers to respond to DNS requests based on the logic in the scripts. Deployment of the scripts is done via our [customer portal](https://portal.cedexis.com/) or [web services API](https://github.com/cedexis/webservices/wiki).

Learn how to use the library to make your own applications in
[the wiki](https://github.com/cedexis/openmixapplib/wiki).
