  This app demonstrates using Pulse Load to obtain current load data for each provider.  It uses this information to filter out providers that are currently overloaded.  Of the remaining providers, it selects the best-performing one.  If all providers are overloaded, it selects the best-performing overall.

  Here is an example of a test object that works with this example script:

  ```
  99
  ```

  The entire content of the object is `99` and in this example it indicates a load value of `99` that will be parsed by the example.
