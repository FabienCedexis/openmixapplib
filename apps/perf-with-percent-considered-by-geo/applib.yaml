  Routes requests to the highest performing available platform, applying an optional
  "percent considered" to each.  The "percent considered" value can me managed globally
  or for each Market or Country. 

  Percent Considered does not need to add up to 100 when summed for all platforms.
  e.g. 100 means the provider is always considered. 50 means the provider is
  considered approximately half the time, 0 means the provider is never considered, etc.
