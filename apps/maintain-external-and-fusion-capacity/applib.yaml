    Demonstrates how to mix Radar performance data with a dynamically maintained list of Cloud Instances. Each cloud instance is associated with a Cloud Provider Region (like AWS US-East) for which we have Radar Performance data. Each instance also has a destination hostname or IP address and a "status". Openmix will first determine the least latent Cloud Region and then Round Robin within the specific Cloud Instances marked as "UP" in the destinations.txt file.
