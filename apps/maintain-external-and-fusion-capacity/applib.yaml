    Demonstrates how to mix Radar performance data with a dynamically maintained list of Cloud Instances. Each cloud instance is associated with a Cloud Provider Region (like AWS US-East) for which we have Radar Performance data. Each instance also has a destination hostname or IP address and a "health" value (1-10). Openmix will first determine the health of all the instances in each region. Regions where instances are struggling will have a handicap applied to their Radar score. This will shed traffic away from struggling regions. Users are sent to least latent Cloud Region and then an instance within using a weighted round robin approach taking into account the instance health score.
