  This application demonstrates using Pulse Load to obtain cloud provider "cost", routing traffic away from a provider once it reaches a certain threshold.  Any servers below the cost threshold will be load-balanced with origin based on round-trip time performance.

  Download the [Openmix application library](http://download.cedexis.com/docs/openmix-library.zip) to get the code and unit test suite for this application, then check out [this tutorial about Openmix application development and testing](/blog/openmix-application-library-upgrades-and-plans/). You'll find this application in **openmix_library/limit-money-spent/app/OpenmixApplication.php**.
